How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, you would first need to gather the requirements for the program. This can be done simply by interviewing users and figuring out their needs for the program, or by conducting surveys, or any number of other data gathering technique.
Once you've gathered your requirements, you can then begin to implement them into your program. This can often times be done by developing a user story for a given need or requirement. For example, in this project, one of the user stories that I created was a "filter by price" story.
As a user of the SNHU travel website, I want to filter my vacations by price, so I can determine which vacations fit into my budget. By creating this user story, I'm able to determine what my program is supposed to do for the user, which in turn makes it easier to implement into my program
because I know what the intended use and function the program is supposed to provide when it is being used.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Because I took this class in conjunction with a systems analysis and design class, I will always approach developing programs by using the basic framework of the SDLC or by following a Business Requirements document to establish a basic outline and flow for my developmental process,
as I have discovered over the course of these classes that these tools are invaluable when approaching system development and design. As far as Agile processes, I hope that I can incorporate the use of Scrum into future development work, as I feel that Scrum will help me become a 
better developer and team member when I start my first job as a developer in the future. I also feel that Scrum will help alleviate some potential struggles that I might have with jobs in the future by promoting collaborative work between team members. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, being a good team member in software development means that you have these principals: Collaborative, Adaptable, Reliable, Communicative, and Accountable. When working in an environment that uses Agile methologies, you have to be collaborative. Being an isolated, reclusive team
member just doesn't work in those situations. Collaboration reinforces your ability to communicate and also ensures that everyone is holding eachother accountable when it comes to work. With ever changing requirements or business needs, you also have to be adaptable to change. Things
will always be changing, and that's okay, you just have to learn how to go with the flow. Lastly, being an effective communicator is a must when considering what it means to be a good team member in software development. You have to be able to express ideas, concerns, feedback, etc. in ways
that make sense but are also tact. Being an effective communicator will also save you when you run into trouble. Learn how to ask for help when you need it!
